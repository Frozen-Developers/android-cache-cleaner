Cache Cleaner [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Frozen-Developers/android-cache-cleaner.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Frozen-Developers/android-cache-cleaner)
======================

Cache Cleaner for Android:

  - KISS philosophy
  - **No ads**
  - Fast and clean
  - Does not require root

That says it all.

Deprecation
-----------
You do not need this app anymore if you are on Android 6.0 or newer. Just go to `Settings` ->
`Storage & USB`-> `Internal storage` and click on `Cached data` in order to clear all the cache.

Partial incompatibility with Android 6.0 and newer
------------------------------------------
Starting with Android 6.0, ```CLEAR_APP_CACHE``` permission seems to be no longer available to
regular applications and since this permission is required for cleaning of internal cache, Cache
Cleaner is not able to clean internal cache on Android 6.0 and newer. However, cleaning of external
cache is still supported.
